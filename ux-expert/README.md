# ux-expert

Always-on UX advisor that surfaces relevant [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com) when building or modifying user interfaces.

## What it does

When you're doing UI/UX work, the agent automatically:

1. **Matches context to laws** — Scans 30 Laws of UX indexed by category and description
2. **Reads relevant laws** — Loads the full law file with key takeaways, origins, and examples
3. **Follows relationships** — Checks each law's Related section and reads deeper when the context warrants it
4. **Fetches external research** — Dives into Further Reading links (NNGroup, Smashing Magazine, etc.) for evidence-based guidance
5. **Gives actionable advice** — Concise, law-backed recommendations: what to do and why
