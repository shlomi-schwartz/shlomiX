# Pareto Principle

The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

## Key Takeaways

1. Inputs and outputs are often not evenly distributed.
2. A large group may contain only a few meaningful contributors to the desired outcome.
3. Focus the majority of effort on the areas that will bring the largest benefits to the most users.

## Origins

Its origins stem back to Vilfredo Pareto, an economist who noticed 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. Though it might seem vague, the 80/20 way of thinking can provide insightful and endlessly applicable analysis of lopsided systems, including user experience strategy.
