## Key Takeaways

## Origins

Bluma Wulfovna Zeigarnik (1900–1988) was a Soviet psychologist and psychiatrist, a member of the Berlin School of experimental psychology and Vygotsky Circle. In the 1920s she conducted a study on memory, comparing memory in relation to incomplete and complete tasks. She found that incomplete tasks are easier to remember than successful ones. This discovery is now known as the Zeigarnik effect. She later worked at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity where she met Vygotsky and became part of his circle of scientists. There she founded the Department of Psychology. Zeigarnik received the Lewin Memorial Award in 1983 for her psychological research.
