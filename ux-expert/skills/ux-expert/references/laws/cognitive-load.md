# Cognitive Load

The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.

## Key Takeaways

1. When information exceeds available mental capacity, users struggle to keep up — tasks become harder, details slip through, and overwhelm sets in.
2. Intrinsic cognitive load refers to the effort required to retain goal-relevant information, absorb new content, and track objectives.
3. Extraneous cognitive load involves mental processing that consumes resources without aiding interface comprehension, such as distracting design elements.

## Origins

Cognitive load theory emerged in the late 1980s from John Sweller's research on problem-solving, expanding George Miller's information processing work. Sweller demonstrated that instructional design reduces cognitive burden in learners, published in his 1988 work "Cognitive Load Theory, Learning Difficulty, and Instructional Design." Subsequent researchers developed methods to measure perceived mental effort as a cognitive load indicator.
