# Working Memory

A cognitive system that temporarily holds and manipulates information needed to complete tasks.

## Key Takeaways

1. Working memory is limited to 4-7 chunks of information at any given moment with each chunk fading after 20-30 seconds. Designers must be mindful of this limit when displaying information to users and ensure it's both necessary and relevant.
2. Our brains excel at recognizing previously encountered information but struggle with retaining new data. Support recognition over recall by visually differentiating visited links and providing breadcrumb navigation.
3. Place the burden of memory on the system, not the user. Reduce memorization demands by carrying information across screens when necessary, such as comparison tables for multiple items.

## Origins

The term "working memory" was coined by George A. Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram in the 1960s within theories comparing the mind to a computer. Richard C. Atkinson and Richard M. Shiffrin adopted the term in 1968 to describe their "short-term store" concept. Modern theorists prefer "working memory" over earlier terms like short-term memory, emphasizing information manipulation rather than passive maintenance. Neural basis research dates back over a century to Eduard Hitzig and Sir David Ferrier's prefrontal cortex ablation experiments. Carlyle Jacobsen and colleagues first demonstrated in 1935-1936 that prefrontal ablation impairs delayed response tasks.
