# Chunking

A process by which individual pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole.

## Key Takeaways

1. Chunking enables users to easily scan content and quickly identify information that aligns with their goals.
2. Structuring content into visually distinct groups with clear hierarchy aligns information with how people evaluate digital content.
3. Chunking helps users understand relationships by grouping content into modules, applying separation rules, and providing hierarchy.

## Origins

The term originates from George A. Miller's 1956 paper "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information." Miller observed that while some human cognitive tasks follow a channel capacity model with constant capacity in bits, short-term memory does not follow this pattern. His work established foundational principles about information processing limits in psychology.
