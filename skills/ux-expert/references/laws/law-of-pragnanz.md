# Law of Pragnanz

People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.

## Key Takeaways

1. The human eye likes to find simplicity and order in complex shapes because it prevents us from becoming overwhelmed with information.
2. Research confirms that people are better able to visually process and remember simple figures than complex figures.
3. The human eye simplifies complex shapes by transforming them into a single, unified shape.

## Origins

In 1910, psychologist Max Wertheimer observed flashing lights at a railroad crossing, similar to marquee bulbs turning on and off sequentially. Observers perceived a single light moving around the marquee rather than individual bulbs lighting up separately. This observation led to descriptive principles about visual perception that became foundational to graphic design practice.
