# Choice Overload

The tendency for people to get overwhelmed when presented with a large number of options, often used interchangeably with the term paradox of choice.

## Key Takeaways

1. Excessive options impair users' decision-making ability and significantly impact how they perceive the overall experience.
2. Enable side-by-side comparison of related items and options requiring decisions (such as pricing tiers) to prevent choice overload when comparison is necessary.
3. Optimize designs for decision-making by prioritizing displayed content, featuring key products, and offering search and filtering tools to narrow choices upfront.

## Origins

Overchoice or choice overload is the paradoxical phenomenon that selecting from a large variety of options can hinder decision-making processes. The term was first introduced by Alvin Toffler in his 1970 book, Future Shock.
