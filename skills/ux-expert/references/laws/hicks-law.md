# Hick's Law

The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

## Key Takeaways

1. Minimize choices when response times are critical to decrease decision time.
2. Break complex tasks into smaller steps in order to decrease cognitive load.
3. Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options.
4. Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.
5. Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.

## Origins

Hick's Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is named after British psychologist William Edmund Hick and American psychologist Ray Hyman. In 1952, this pair examined the relationship between the number of stimuli present and an individual's reaction time to any given stimulus. As the number of stimuli increases, users require more time to make decisions. Users faced with excessive choices must invest effort interpreting and deciding among options they did not seek.
