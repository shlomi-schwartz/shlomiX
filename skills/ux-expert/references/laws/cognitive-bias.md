# Cognitive Bias

A systematic error of thinking or rationality in judgment that influence our perception of the world and our decision-making ability.

## Key Takeaways

1. We develop mental shortcuts based on past experiences to conserve energy and make quick decisions, though these can unconsciously influence judgment without thorough analysis.
2. Understanding our own biases may not eliminate them completely but increases the chance we can identify them in ourselves and others as safeguards against flawed reasoning and costly mistakes.
3. Confirmation bias — our tendency to seek, interpret, and recall information confirming preconceived notions — can make logical discussions on polarizing topics incredibly difficult.

## Origins

Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman introduced cognitive biases in 1972 after observing people's inability to reason intuitively with greater orders of magnitude. Through replicable experiments, they demonstrated that human judgment and decision-making differ from rational choice theory, explaining differences through heuristics — mental shortcuts providing quick probability estimates about uncertain events that can introduce severe and systematic errors.
