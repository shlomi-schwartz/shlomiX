# Mental Model

A compressed model based on what we think we know about a system and how it works.

## Key Takeaways

1. We form working models in our minds about how systems operate, then apply those models to similar new situations.
2. Aligning designs with users' mental models improves experiences and enables knowledge transfer across products without requiring relearning.
3. Product success depends on alignment between design and user expectations, as demonstrated by consistent e-commerce patterns like product cards and checkout flows.
4. Closing the gap between designer and user mental models requires research methods including user interviews, personas, journey maps, and empathy maps.

## Origins

The concept of mental models originated with psychologist Kenneth Craik in his 1943 book *The Nature of Explanation*. Craik proposed that people maintain small-scale mental representations of how the world functions, which they use to anticipate events, reason through problems, and construct explanations.
