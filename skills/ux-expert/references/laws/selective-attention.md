# Selective Attention

The process of focusing our attention only to a subset of stimuli in an environment — usually those related to our goals.

## Key Takeaways

1. People filter out irrelevant information to maintain focus on important details. Designers should guide user attention, prevent overwhelm, and help users locate relevant information or actions.
2. Banner Blindness exemplifies selective attention: users consciously or unconsciously ignore banner-like information and content resembling ads. Avoid styling content as ads or placing it near actual advertisements.
3. Change Blindness occurs when significant interface changes go unnoticed due to limited human attention and insufficient visual cues. Designers should analyze for competing simultaneous changes that might distract from important updates.

## Origins

Selective Attention Theory emerged in the mid-20th century as researchers investigated how humans process environmental information. Donald Broadbent's Filter Theory (1958) proposed an attentional "bottleneck" limiting simultaneous information processing. E. Colin Cherry's Cocktail Party Effect research (1953) examined selective auditory attention. Anne Treisman's Attenuation Model (1960) refined Broadbent's work, suggesting unattended information is attenuated rather than blocked. Deutsch and Deutsch's Late Selection Theory (1963) proposed all sensory information receives full semantic processing before selection occurs. Research motivation included practical concerns like radar operator performance during World War II. Focus shifted from auditory to visual tasks throughout the 1950s-1970s, with capacity theories like Kahneman's (1973) viewing attention as a limited resource divisible across tasks.
