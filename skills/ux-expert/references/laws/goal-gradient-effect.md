# Goal-Gradient Effect

The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.

## Key Takeaways

1. The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it.
2. Providing artificial progress towards a goal will help to ensure users are more likely to have the motivation to complete that task.
3. Provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete tasks.

## Origins

The goal-gradient hypothesis, originally proposed by the behaviorist Clark Hull in 1932, states that the tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal. In a classic experiment that tests this hypothesis, Hull (1934) found that rats in a straight alley ran progressively faster as they proceeded from the starting box to the food. Although the goal-gradient hypothesis has been investigated extensively with animals, its implications for human behavior and decision making are understudied. Furthermore, this issue has important theoretical and practical implications for intertemporal consumer behavior in reward programs and other types of motivational systems.
