# Paradox of the Active User

Users never read manuals but start using the software immediately.

## Key Takeaways

1. Users prioritize completing immediate tasks and avoid spending time reading documentation upfront.
2. This paradox persists because long-term optimization requires users to invest time learning the system initially.
3. Embed guidance throughout the product experience contextually (such as tooltips) to support active new users regardless of their chosen path.

## Origins

Mary Beth Rosson and John Carroll introduced this concept in 1987 within their work on interaction design, "Interfacing thought: cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction." Their research demonstrated that new users bypassed supplied manuals entirely, instead immediately attempting to use software despite encountering errors and obstacles.
