# Tesler's Law

Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.

## Key Takeaways

1. All processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user.
2. Ensure as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development.
3. Remember to not build products and services for an idealized, rational user, because people don't always behave rationally in real life.
4. Make guidance accessible and fit within the context of use so that it can help these active new users, no matter what path they choose to take (e.g., tooltips with helpful information).

## Origins

While working for Xerox PARC in the mid-1980s, Larry Tesler realized that the way users interact with applications was just as important as the application itself. The book Designing for Interaction by Dan Saffer includes an interview with Larry Tesler that describes the law of conservation of complexity. Larry Tesler argues that engineers should spend extra time reducing application complexity rather than having millions of users spend extra minutes due to that complexity. However, Bruce Tognazzini proposes that people resist reductions to complexity in their lives, and when applications are simplified, users often attempt more complex tasks.
