# Law of Common Region

Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.

## Key Takeaways

1. Common region creates a clear structure and helps users quickly and effectively understand the relationship between elements and sections.
2. Adding a border around an element or group of elements is an easy way to create common region.
3. Common region can also be created by defining a background behind an element or group of elements.

## Origins

The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Pragnanz. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.
